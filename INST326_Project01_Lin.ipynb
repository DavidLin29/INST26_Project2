If you do more programming in tkinter beyond this course you should learn and program with ttk from the start.

DO NOT copy code from online examples or use generative AI like ChatGPT to generate your code. You may follow the examples in the BroCode video.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "1. Create a window and name it 'Project 01: Blackjack Game'. Refer to lab 02.\n",
    "2. Instantiate a game and name it mygame.\n",
    "3. Create a shuffled deck named mydeck using the make_deck method from your new game instance, mygame. Remember that every card in your deck is actually a tkinter button. You have instantiated them but have not added them to the window yet.\n",
    "4. Create two hands, one for player1 and one for the dealer, and deal the hands using the deal method you created in your mygame instance. You may create the hands in the main code cell, or you may create a method within your game class - it's your choice (method in the game class might be better). Set the 'hand' attribute of each card to reflect the hand it belongs to. (Hint: if you create a method, you might consider adding two attributes to your class: player1_hand and dealer_hand. Set them to empty lists [] by default.)\n",
    "5. Either during the deal or after, set the 'display' attribute of the second card dealt to the dealer to 'backtk'. Take a look at the Cardbutton class and notice that the display attribute is set to 'facetk' by default.  <font color = red>**Change to the display requirements: All player cards to be displayed face-up. Second dealer card to be displayed face-down.**</font>  \n",
    "6. Create a method in your game class to calculate the score (sum of card values) for each hand - player1 and dealer. Hint: you might create player1_score and dealer_score attributes in your game class. Set the to 0 by default.\n",
    "7. Create two tkinter labels, one for player1 and 1 for the dealer. The text for each label should display as two lines (include '\\n' where you want the line break.) The first line should display the player or players name (you could include an input statement to get the player's name). The second line should include the player's score. EXCEPT: do not show the dealers score until after the 'Call' button is pressed.\n",
    "8. Create four regular buttons (not Cardbuttons) using the tk.Button() method: Hit, Stay, Call, and Quit. The command= attribute should reference the respective methods you created (or will create) in the game class. See Below.\n",
    "8a. hit button / hit method. the hit method should draw a card from the deck and add it to the player's (or dealer's) hand, updating the card's 'hand' attribute. The player's (or dealer's) score should be updated to reflect the value of the additional card. The players (or dealer's) label should be updated with the new score using the label.config() method. The new card should be added to the window - face up.\n",
    "8b. stay button / stay method. the stay button is clicked when player1 has taken all the hit cards they want. the stay method then initiates an automated 'hit' sequence for the dealer according to the following rule: if dealer_score < 17, hit; else stay. Dealer's score and cards in the window are updated with each hit.\n",
    "8c. call button / call method. Onece the dealer's hand has been updated in the stay method, the player presses the call button to compute and display all scores, show all cards, determine a winner, and display the winner message in the window. If both the player and dealer scores are greater than 21, there is no winner. if the scores are the same it is a tie. Else, the hand with the closest score <= 21 is the winner. If it is the player, display the message \"Winner winner, chicken dinner!\" in the window. If the dealer wins, display \"House wins.\" in the window.\n",
    "8d. quit button: the command= attribute should be: command=window.destroy. That will close the window and end the program.\n",
    "9. Add all your widgets to the window. We will be using tkinter grid layout (refer to lab 2). add 20px of padding (x and y) to each item.\n",
    "9a. add player1 label to row 1, column 0. Add dealer label to row 2, column 0.\n",
    "9b. Create a loop to add your cards. player cards in row 1, dealer cards in row 2.\n",
    "9c. Add your four play buttons (hit, stay, call, and quit) to row 3 and columns 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "10. ~Add a 'peek' method that allows the player to see the cards in their hand. You may do this in one of two ways - your choice.~  \n",
    "~10a. Display the player's cards face up in a new window (refer to Lab 02) *OR:*  \n",
    "10b. Modify the Cardbutton.on_hover() method as follows: add image=self.facetk to the self.config() statement (refer to the on_leave() method for format. Then place the self.config() statement inside an if statement that only executes self.config() if self.hand == 'player1'. else, it's just self.config(bg=\"lightblue\"). This conditional loop prevents the player from peeking at the dealer's cards.~  <font color = red>*Since players hands will be displayed face-up, the functionality in step 10 is no longer needed.*</font>  \n",
    "11. Make sure your last line is: window.mainloop()\n",
    "12. Document your code with comments.\n",
